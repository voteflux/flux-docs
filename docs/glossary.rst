   Direct Democracy
      Voters are directly involved in voting on every issue.

   IBDD
   Issue Based Direct Democracy
      An advancement from :term:`Liquid Democracy` with an internal market for apathetic or unused votes. IBDD allows for individuals to vote directly, delegate to a trusted authority on an issue or trade their vote for more of a say on another issue. The system should operate such that all of the available votes are engaged on every issue at the expense of credits given to each voter. The credits are distributed to each voter equally every year such that they can enhance their say on issues which matter to them. Issues which a voter is apathetic to become an opportunity to gain more credits, so that they may have greater sway on the issues that matter to them if they do not cast a vote. So less contested legislation will be passed easily with fewer credits required to acquire more votes, and more contested legislation will require more "political capital" as there will be fewer apathetic votes and more demand for said votes so the "political cost" of enacting more votes will be higher.

   Liquid Democracy
      See `this article <https://medium.com/organizer-sandbox/liquid-democracy-true-democracy-for-the-21st-century-7c66f5e53b6f>`_:

      "Liquid Democracy is a new form for collective decision making that gives voters full decisional control. Voters can either vote directly on issues, or they can delegate their voting power to delegates (i.e. representatives) who vote on their behalf. Delegation can be domain specific, which means that voters can delegate their voting power to different experts in different domains."
